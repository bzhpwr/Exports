What pywsgi is:

  - An abstraction from low-level gateway interface handlers like WSGI,
    CGI, and mod_python.
  - A consistent high-level, class-based interface.
  - Session handling.
  - Cookie handling.
  - GET/POST data handling.
  - Error handling.
  - A pywsgi.util namespace with useful tools.

What pywsgi is not:
  - An official Python project.
  - A Python implementation of the WSGI specification. Instead, this module
    wraps the exising low-level Python implementation (which is named
    wsgiref).
